"""Module to genderize job titles in ROME.

This module allows one to normalize French job titles across genders in
ROME. In the standard ROME file provided by Pole Emploi job titles are often
inconsistently specified, which leads to confusion and poorer user experience.
In addition it makes the job title longer than it should be, which makes them
harder to identify at a glance.

For readability English-language examples are provided in the comments in this
module.

Example:
A job such as "Senior Fireman" might sometimes be genderized as
"Senior Fireman / Senior Firewoman" and sometimes as "Senior Fire(wo)man".
We want to turn any variant of these possible genderizations into a
normalized pair of two strings: "Senior Fireman" and "Senior Firewoman".
If a job title is not gendered, for example "Artist", we want to simply return
"Artist" and "Artist".

Nomenclature in this module:
- bracket notation: when the job title is gendered using the form
                    "Senior Fire(wo)man"
- slash notation:   when the job title is gendered using the form
                    "Senior Fireman / Firewoman"

# This variable is a {postfix: [word_endings]} dictionary of lists
# describing how a postfix is supposed to transform a word based on its
# possible word endings. These are strings that, when found at the end
# of the word to be transformed, will be replaced by the postfix.
# If a postfix is meant to be simply appended to a word, the empty
# string should be used.
# Note that the list ordering matters and must be from more specific
# to more general (ie. in decreasing order of length), as the postfix
# substitution will perform the first substitution that matches the last
# characters of the word to be transformed.
# Example: {'euse': ['eur', 'er']} means that the postfix 'euse' will
# transform 'Vendeur' into 'Vendeuse' and 'Manager' into 'Manageuse'.
# Status: This list is currently comprehensive with regards to the postfixes
# found in ROME v238, with the exception of the 's' postfix as it
# denotes pluralization rather than gender.
