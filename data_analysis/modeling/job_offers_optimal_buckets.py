"""Functions to compute optimal buckets on job postings table.
Basically we have a set of buckets we would want if we had enough data.
When it's not the case, we fuse buckets together. Here are the main steps:
1. We count number of offers in each of the buckets we want (OPTIMAL_BUCKETS)
2. We iterate over buckets and where there is not enough offers (< _MIN_PER_BIN)
we fuse bucket with the preceding one.
3. We use a couple of functions to reconstruct the new buckets and get labels
4. We use one last function that give, from one given experience,
the associated bucket.
5. We compute all these steps inside a function, and put this function inside
a closure in order to apply it to the each offers of each job groups.

Warning about 2: if we got only offers requiring 12 months of experience
for instance, we'll have only a [0, 999] bucket (instead of [12, 999]).
It means that we'll still give a reco for a user of 3 months of experience,
even if there is no offer under 12 months of experience. It's a choice.
