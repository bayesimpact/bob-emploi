"""This script extracts multiple job groups of jobseekers from FHS.

Pôle emploi categorizes job seekers in several categories (A, B, ... F). In
this script we focus on category ABC.

It creates a simple CSV table that can then be used more easily than the very large FHS.
Each row represents a contiguous period of time for which a job seeker was in category
ABC unemployment. However, only the first period and the later periods where a job seeker has
changed the job they were looking for are kept.
As such a jobseeker might be represented by several rows.
It provides a list of criteria for jobseekers (ROME job group, département ID, gender).

To create this dataset, you can run:
    docker-compose run --rm data-analysis-prepare python \
        bob_emploi/data_analysis/importer/fhs_job_mobility.py \
        "data/pole_emploi/FHS/FHS*201512" \
        2015-12-01 \
        data/fhs_job_mobility.csv
