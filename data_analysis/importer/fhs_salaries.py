"""This script extracts salaries information from FHS.

It creates a simple CSV table that contains some kind of datacubes about
jobseekers that can then be used more easily than the very large FHS. The
datacube contains for each row a list of criteria for jobseekers (ROME job
group, d√©partement ID, gender, age bucket, salary bucket) and then the number
of jobseekers that have the same criteria.

If you managed to get your hands on the FHS dataset, you can run:
    docker-compose run --rm data-analysis-prepare python \
        bob_emploi/importer/fhs_salaries.py \
        "data/pole_emploi/FHS/FHS*201512" \
