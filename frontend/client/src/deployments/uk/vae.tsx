    <p>NVQ is short for National Vocational Qualification, and this is a
      skill-based qualification. This means you receive qualifications for learning practical
      tasks that relate to a job and that help you to do a job effectively. You can receive
      an NVQ if you already have work-based skills and want to improve them, or if you are just
      starting out.</p>
    <p>There are five levels of NVQ that range from Level 1, based on basic work activities,
      up to Level 5, which is for senior management.</p>
    <p>It's important to know that NVQs must be completed within a training program.
      You can take NVQs if you are employed, are studying at FE college and working part-time,
      are completing an apprenticeship, or are at school.</p>
