Fellow reviewers, do not forget to:
• check that a new user can go through the workflow, see their assessment and select and read some advice, without being blocked. :rocket:
• check the flow for desktop and mobile. :iphone: :computer:
• go to the <http://go/bob:demo/tag-$TAG/conseiller/integration-imilo|integration-imilo page> to check all the pieces of advice.
• @eng, make sure no error has been logged to <https://sentry.io/bayes-impact/bob-emploi-demo/|bob-emploi-demo> on Sentry.
• of course have a look to the release notes to know where to be even more careful.
Bob will be forever grateful :heart:"
