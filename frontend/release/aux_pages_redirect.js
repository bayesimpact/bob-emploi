// AWS Lambda @Edge script to redirect URLs going to auxiliary pages (i.e. not
// from the main app) to their respective entrypoints.
//
// We need that because those are actually single page applications that need
// to be served from various URLs by a static html pages.
// As those pages are rarely accessed, it's OK to run this quick lambda to find
// the page to serve.
//
// The source of this file is in bob-emploi-internal git repo:
// frontend/release/aux_pages_redirect.js
// and should be deployed using the frontend/release/deploy_lambda.sh script.

// List of URLs redirect to auxiliary pages.
