# Bob Project History

This is a high level (non-technical) view of the Bob product history. For a detailed technical changelog of recent Bob releases, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

*Note that this is history as seen in hindsight, events were not necessarily perceived as such at the time.*

**June 2015**: Paul's [talk at l'Échappée Volée](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AdHZmTHHA8) starts the initial momentum around the project idea (using algorithms to help the unemployed).

**Oct. 2015**: Brainstorming between Paul & Stephan to figure out how to best tackle the (broad) problem; first product idea: "MyGamePlan" (a tool to simulate career decisions).

**Dec. 2015**: First interactive demo prototype - [GitHub](https://github.com/bayesimpact/giga-le-jobs) - [Demo](http://giga-le-jobs.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/#/onboarding/step1).

**Jan. 2016**: Partnership signed with Pôle emploi to research data-driven recommendations based on anonymized data.

**Mar. 2016**: Build project team in France, build a functional prototype, rewrite code for the long term: "MyGamePlan" becomes "Parcours Emploi".

**June 2016**: First user test session at Pôle Emploi Lab; decision to keep exploring other product ideas as feedback is inconclusive.

**Summer 2016**: 4 prototypes in 4 weeks: Plan Comparator, Companion, Game Plan Builder, Daily "Bob the bot" Emails (this is where the "Bob" name first appeared). Another prototype not finished: Checklist.

**Sept. 2016**: Mix best product ideas together ("Mashup"); project gets named "Bob Emploi": a coach that provides daily personalized actions.

**Nov. 2016**: Fix bugs and iterations on each feature of the Mashup. Sticky Actions attempt, but the feature doesn't stick :(

**12 Dec. 2016**: Strong decision to refocus Bob's core value proposition for the "Advisor" (providing high-level strategic advice rather than daily tips), in order to maximize the potential impact.

**Jan. 2017**: Start measuring [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter), among other metrics; make the drastic choice to stop the Mashup and switch to the early Advisor so as to enable faster development.

**16 Jan. 2017**: Export of Bob's code to an Open Source repo.

**8 Feb. 2017**: Bob goes mobile.

**17 Feb. 2017**: Decision to rollback to the Mashup and work undercover until we're ready to switch.

**Feb. 2017**: Iterate on Advisor UX.

**24 Mar. 2017**: Advisor is still early, but we deem it ready for prime time. Release the Advisor for new users.

**12 Apr. 2017**: Release the Advisor for all users. Implement the Bob Score feature.

**Apr. 2017**: Iterate on Onboarding and Dashboard Flow.

**May 2017**: Refine Value Proposition: Bob's goal is to "create sparks" and inspire users to think of new job search strategies. Creation of many advice modules.

**June 2017**: Focus on making the Value Proposition clear to users. Launch project modification feature.

**July 2017**: Add sections in Dashboard to better differentiate between each piece of advice's priority level. Value Proposition is clear for team and users.

**18 July 2017**: End of milestone 1 "Value Proposition is clear for team and users", beginning of work on milestone 2 "Reasonable quality content".

**August 2017**: Create an evaluation tool to measure the quality content and the advice selection on day 1.

**5 September 2017**: End of milestone 2 "Reasonable quality content". Start working on milestone 3 "Ready for growth".

**Currently**: Work in progress
