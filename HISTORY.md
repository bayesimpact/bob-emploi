# Bob project history

This is a high level (nontechnical) view of the Bob product history. For a detailed technical changelog of recent Bob releases, see [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/bayesimpact/bob-emploi/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
*Note that this is history as seen with hindsight, events were not necessarily perceived as such at the time.*

**June 2015:** Paul's [talk at l'Échappée Volée](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AdHZmTHHA8) starts the initial momentum around the project idea (using algorithms to help the unemployed).

**Oct. 2015:** Brainstorming between Paul & Stephan to figure out how to best tackle the (very broad) problem; first product idea: "MyGamePlan" (a tool to simulate career decisions).

**Dec. 2015:** First interactive demo prototype.

**Jan. 2016:** Partnership signed with Pôle emploi to research data-driven recommendations based on anonymized data.

**March 2016:** Build project team in France, build a functional prototype, rewrite code for the long term: "MyGamePlan" becomes "Parcours Emploi".

**June 2016:** First user test session at Pôle Emploi Lab; decision to keep exploring other product ideas as feedback is inconclusive.

**Summer 2016:** 4 prototypes in 4 weeks (Plan Comparator, Companion, Game Plan Builder, Bob Daily Emails). Another prototype not finished: Checklist.

**Sept. 2016:** Mix best product ideas together ("Mashup"); project gets named "Bob Emploi": a coach that provides daily personalized actions.

**2016-11-15:** Bob Emploi Public Beta Launch!

**Nov. 2016:** Fix bugs and iterations on each feature of the Mashup. Sticky Actions attempt, but the feature doesn't stick.

**2016-12-20:** Strong decision to refocus Bob's core value proposition for the “Advisor” (providing high-level strategic advice rather than daily tips), in order to maximize the potential impact.

**Jan 2017:** Start measuring NPS (among other metrics); make the drastic choice to start from scratch and switch to the early Advisor so as to enable faster development.

**2017-02-08:** Bob goes mobile!

**2017-02-17:** Decision to rollback to the Mashup and work undercover until we're ready to switch.

**Feb 2017:** Iterate on Advisor UX.

**2017-03-24:** Advisor is still early, but we deem it ready for prime time. Release the Advisor for new users.

**2017-04-12:** Release the Advisor for all users. Implement Bob Score feature.

**Apr 2017:** Iterate on Onboarding and Dashboard Flow.

**May 2017:** Refine Value Proposition: Bob's goal is to "create sparks" and inspire users to think of new job search strategies. Creation of many advice modules.

**June 2017:** Focus on making the Value Proposition clear to users. Launch project modification feature.

**July 2017:** Add sections in Dashboard to better differentiate between each piece of advice's priority level. Value Proposition is clear for team and users.

**2017-07-18:** End of milestone 1 “Value Proposition is clear for team and users”, beginning of milestone 2 “Reasonable quality content”.
