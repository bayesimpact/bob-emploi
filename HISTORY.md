# Bob Project History

This is a high level (non-technical) view of the Bob product history. For a detailed technical changelog of recent Bob releases, see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

*Note that this is history as seen in hindsight, events were not necessarily perceived as such at the time.*

**June 2015**: Paul's [talk at l'Échappée Volée](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AdHZmTHHA8) starts the initial momentum around the project idea (using algorithms to help the unemployed).

**Oct. 2015**: Brainstorming between Paul & Stephan to figure out how to best tackle the (broad) problem; first product idea: "MyGamePlan" (a tool to simulate career decisions).

**Dec. 2015**: First interactive demo prototype - [GitHub](https://github.com/bayesimpact/giga-le-jobs) - [Demo](http://giga-le-jobs.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/#/onboarding/step1).

**Jan. 2016**: Partnership signed with Pôle emploi to research data-driven recommendations based on anonymized data.

**Mar. 2016**: Build project team in France, build a functional prototype, rewrite code for the long term: "MyGamePlan" becomes "Parcours Emploi".

**June 2016**: First user test session at Pôle Emploi Lab; decision to keep exploring other product ideas as feedback is inconclusive.

**Summer 2016**: 4 prototypes in 4 weeks: Plan Comparator, Companion, Game Plan Builder, Daily "Bob the bot" Emails (this is where the "Bob" name first appeared). Another prototype not finished: Checklist.

**Sept. 2016**: Mix best product ideas together ("Mashup"); project gets named "Bob Emploi": a coach that provides daily personalized actions.
